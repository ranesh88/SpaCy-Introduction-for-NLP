# SpaCy-Introduction-for-NLP

spaCy is a free, open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.

spaCy is designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and “understand” large volumes of text.

It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning.
